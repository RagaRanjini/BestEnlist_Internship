Hi I made this " project-1 " repository during the 1 month internship of python with Best Enlist.

Best Enlist is one of the developing Software Development companies in chennai , conducting 30 days internships / bootcamps on various  technologies for college students ,  job seekers and those who wish to move from BPO to IT .

WEBSITE : https://www.bestenlist.co.in/
LINKEDIN : https://www.linkedin.com/company/bestenlist/

DURATION DATE :  November 24/2020 - December 25/2020

I completed 12 tasks in 12 days and then 3 projects which includes 2 mini projects and 1 main project in the remaining days.

Mini Projects : 
1. pong game
2. coffee maker system

With the problems solved at the start of internship , I got to know the basics of python such as data structures , loops , functions , creation and implementation of module in python and so on. The development of coffee maker system helped to get an idea of usage of ‘functions’ and ‘conditional statements’  in python . Similarly , developing pong game helped to learn about ‘turtle’ (inbuilt) library and keyboard events in python .

Main Project : OCR (Open ‘projectOCR.py’ for codes , and ‘OCR project output.pdf’ to view output)

Analysis of ‘tesseract’ played a vital role in my final project since it is the reference given .With this analysis , I was able to learn that tesseract is an optical character recognition engine and more about its usage . I got to learn and also used the concept of ‘file handling’ in my project to implement the applications of tesseract .

I got to have hands on experience on: Python language 

It was an amazing learning experience personally for myself since I did this one when I was pursuing 1st year B.E Computer Science and Engineering .
